we are using (for the client) a DataOutputStream object in which we will define the following policy 

the client will send an initial singal byte in confirmation of whether they want to keep the connection,
or end it
-keeping a connection will head a packet with a 1  being sent 
-to end a connection and tell the server the client no longer wants to talk, a -1 will be send

the server will listen constantly and inside of its 'forever' loop, it will contain a case statement
this statement will parse the initla byte that is sent and act accordingly, obviously in the case of a
1 being received, the server will then expect another message to be sent, and will then promptly decode it, 
print it out on its side, and then echo the message encoded again back to the client. if a -1 is received,
the server will close all of its open sockets, streamreaders, etc.

--left off changing the code to send one byte to the server before the actual message, 
partially changed the client code but not the server yet, i had to stop and get a calzone
before i make any more changes(1-2-23)


we have chosen to send a single bit(1 or 0) to define whether the socket should close or not on the server side
then after that bit it sent, move on from there


we have finished the first two parts of the assignment, we now must calculate throughput by sending 1MB of data to a server
and an 8 byte ACK back using (1024 1024Byte messages, vs 2048 512Byte messages, vs 8192 X 128Byte messages) as specified
per Professor Lea

TransferTime = RTT + 1 / Bandwidth + TransferSize

throughput = TransferSize / TransferTime

we left off making sure the throughput calculation in the TCP section was accurate, i believe it is
we now need to start/finish the UDP section and then create two scripts automating the graphs, more
on that later, date: 2/14/23

thoughts on how to capture a large amount of data through a script for the overall RTT and Throughput for each problem:
have the server file running on a server(pi, rho, etc) and call the function that runs over all the code, and then
create a function inside of each .java file that would just capture the data we want(RTT or Throughout) and return that.
Then the script I have running will pipe that info to a file in a CSV format and then we can do with that as we please
(i.e. use graph.js for webpage etc.).
