This is a place to keep notes

There are several part of this project and some can't/are annoying to implement rn, such as
setting up a machine on a different network and creating a server to send acknowledgements back
and accept some random data(we'll use my pi but lets just use the school servers for now)

date: 26-1-23
for now we will focus on the bare bones and set up some sort of communication with the school servers
