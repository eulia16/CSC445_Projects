we are using (for the client) a DataOutputStream object in which we will define the following policy 

the client will send an initial singal byte in confirmation of whether they want to keep the connection,
or end it
-keeping a connection will head a packet with a 1  being sent 
-to end a connection and tell the server the client no longer wants to talk, a -1 will be send

the server will listen constantly and inside of its 'forever' loop, it will contain a case statement
this statement will parse the initla byte that is sent and act accordingly, obviously in the case of a
1 being received, the server will then expect another message to be sent, and will then promptly decode it, 
print it out on its side, and then echo the message encoded again back to the client. if a -1 is received,
the server will close all of its open sockets, streamreaders, etc.

--left off changing the code to send one byte to the server before the actual message, 
partially changed the client code but not the server yet, i had to stop and get a calzone
before i make any more changes(1-2-23)
